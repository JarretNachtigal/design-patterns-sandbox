# "This looks a lot like the Flyweight pattern." --
# "Flyweight objects are reused by sharing the same instance between multiple owners simultaneously.
# The Flyweight pattern avoids duplicate memory usage by using the same object in multiple contexts."

# The objects in a pool get reused too, but only over time. “Reuse” in the context of an object pool
# means reclaiming the memory for an object after the original owner is done with it. With an object pool,
# there isn’t any expectation that an object will be shared within its lifetime."
