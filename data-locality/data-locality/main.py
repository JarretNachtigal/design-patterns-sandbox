# "organize your data structures so that the things you’re processing are next to each other in memory."

# "Modern computers have a little chunk of memory right inside the chip. The CPU can pull data from this much faster than it can from main memory."

# "Whenever your chip needs a byte of data from RAM, it automatically grabs a whole chunk of contiguous memory — usually around 64 to 128 bytes — and puts it in the cache.
# This dollop of memory is called a cache line."
