# "Components are basically plug-and-play for objects. They let us build complex entities with rich behavior
# by plugging different reusable component objects into sockets on the entity."

# "letâ€™s try it with components. Our subclasses disappear completely.
# Instead, we have a single GameObject class and two component classes: PhysicsComponent and GraphicsComponent.
# A decoration is simply a GameObject with a GraphicsComponent but no PhysicsComponent.
# A zone is the opposite, and a prop has both components."

# "A single entity spans multiple domains."
# "The entity is reduced to a simple container of components."
