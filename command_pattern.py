# NOTES
#
# "A command is a reified method call."
#
# "Both terms mean taking some concept and turning it into a piece of data
#  — an object — that you can stick in a variable, pass to a function, etc.
# So by saying the Command pattern is a “reified method call”, what I mean is that
# it’s a method call wrapped in an object."
