# "each entity in the game should encapsulate its own behavior."

# "Once per frame, the game loop walks the collection and calls update()
#  on each object. This gives each one a chance to perform one frame’s worth
# of behavior. By calling it on all objects every frame,
# they all behave simultaneously."

# "Update methods work well when:

# - Your game has a number of objects or systems that need to run simultaneously.
# - Each object’s behavior is mostly independent of the others.
# - The objects need to be simulated over time."
