# "each entity in the game should encapsulate its own behavior.""
# "Once per frame, the game loop walks the collection and calls update()
#  on each object. This gives each one a chance to perform one frameâ€™s worth
# of behavior. By calling it on all objects every frame,
# they all behave simultaneously."
