# this file will hold the main method for the game loop pattern
# essentially it is a while loop that calls the update method(s)
# for each tic of in game time
# in prebuild engines like unity, this is already implemented and needs to
# be worked with correctly

    # while loop:
    # process_input()
    # update() # state pattern?
    # render() # double buffer?
    pass
