# this file contains the main method for the double buffer pattern
# https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/double-buffer.html
# "A buffered class encapsulates a buffer: a piece of state that can be modified.
# This buffer is edited incrementally, but we want all outside code to see the edit
# as a single atomic change. To do this, the class keeps two instances of the buffer:
# a next buffer and a current buffer."
