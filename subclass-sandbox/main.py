# "Let’s say we unleash our team and get them writing superpower classes. What’s going to happen?
# - There will be lots of redundant code.
# - Every part of the game engine will get coupled to these classes.
# - When these outside systems need to change, odds are good some random superpower code will get broken.
# - It’s hard to define invariants that all superpowers obey."
